# LSL inlet plugin
A simple plugin to recieve from one LSL EEG and one LSL Markers stream on the network.

### Windows
This is currently built for windows only. I believe you can download the latest lsl libraries for your system, put them in the libs folder and update the CMakeLists accordingly. Contact @markschatza for assistance. 

### Building the plugins
Building the plugins requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Detailed instructions on how to build open ephys plugins with CMake can be found in [the Open Ephys GUI documentation](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/Developer-Guide/Compiling-plugins.html).
